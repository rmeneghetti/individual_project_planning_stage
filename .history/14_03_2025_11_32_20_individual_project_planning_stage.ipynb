    "Provide a full descriptive summary of the dataset, including information such as the number of observations, summary statistics, number of variables, name and type of variables, what the variables mean, any issues you see in the data, any other potential issues related to things you cannot directly see, how the data were collected, etc. Make sure to use bullet point lists or tables to summarize the variables in an easy-to-understand format.\n",

In fact, exploring how the different variables in the dataset affect your model may be a crucial part of the project.

    "Experience: The experience column describes the experience level of the player. There are 5 different experience levels including beginner, amateur, regular, pro, and veteran. \n",

Some people may leave the game open and come back to it so this could cause issues when looking at the data."

Your question should involve one response variable of interest and one or more explanatory variables, and should be stated as a question.
