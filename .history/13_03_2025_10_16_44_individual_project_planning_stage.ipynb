    "Provide a full descriptive summary of the dataset, including information such as the number of observations, summary statistics, number of variables, name and type of variables, what the variables mean, any issues you see in the data, any other potential issues related to things you cannot directly see, how the data were collected, etc. Make sure to use bullet point lists or tables to summarize the variables in an easy-to-understand format.\n",

In fact, exploring how the different variables in the dataset affect your model may be a crucial part of the project.

    "Clearly state one broad question that you will address, and the specific question that you have formulated. Your question should involve one response variable of interest and one or more explanatory variables, and should be stated as a question. One common question format is: “Can [explanatory variable(s)] predict [response variable] in [dataset]?”, but you are free to format your question as you choose so long as it is clear. Describe clearly how the data will help you address the question of interest. You may need to describe how you plan to wrangle your data to get it into a form where you can apply one of the predictive methods from this class.\n"
