    "Broad question: We would like to know which \"kinds\" of players are most likely to contribute a large amount of data so that we can target those players in our recruiting efforts. Specific question: What age group of players is most likley to contribute to playing time (in hours)? The data will help me to address this question as age and hours played are both variables given in the players dataset. Using this data, I can group the ages together and see the average playing time (in hours) of each age group. I can use the group_by and summarize functions to find the time spent playing the game for each age."
