In fact, exploring how the different variables in the dataset affect your model may be a crucial part of the project.

In the players dataset (containing 196 rows), there are 7 columns - experience, subscribe, hashedEmail, played_hours, name, age, and gender.

    "Clearly state one broad question that you will address, and the specific question that you have formulated. Your question should involve one response variable of interest and one or more explanatory variables, and should be stated as a question. One common question format is: “Can [explanatory variable(s)] predict [response variable] in [dataset]?”, but you are free to format your question as you choose so long as it is clear. Describe clearly how the data will help you address the question of interest. You may need to describe how you plan to wrangle your data to get it into a form where you can apply one of the predictive methods from this class.\n"

    "Broad question: We would like to know which \"kinds\" of players are most likely to contribute a large amount of data so that we can target those players in our recruiting efforts. Specific question: What age group of players is most likley to contribute to playing time (in hours)? The data will help me to address this question as age and hours played are both variables given in the players dataset. Using this data, I can group the ages together and see the average playing time (in hours) of each age group. I can use the group_by and summarize functions to find the time spent playing the game for each age."
